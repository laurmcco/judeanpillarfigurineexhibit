**Look Again: Guiding Questions for the Use of this Web Exhibit by Educators**
(There are imbrications among the following disciplinary approaches)

-THINK LIKE A CONSERVATOR: What questions can be pursued by Reflectance Transformation Imaging? Pick a point of interest on one of the JPFs imaged on this site and theorize what it might reveal.

-THINK LIKE A COMPUTER SCIENTIST: How does the computer "know" the position of a light source in RTI capture?

-THINK LIKE A CURATOR: What stories do Judean Pillar Figurines tell about Israelite women? 

-THINK LIKE AN ARCHAEOLOGIST: Judean Pillar Figurines are found ubiquitously throughout ancient Judean towns. What can broad find-spots (in public and private buildings, in streets, alleyways, and cisterns, as fill underneath floors and in mud brick walls, in tombs, and especially in and around Judean homes) reveal about the use life of these objects?

-THINK LIKE A BIBLICAL SCHOLAR: JPFs are from ancient Judah. Research ancient Judean conceptualizations of clay via the Bible. How does the fact that an object is made out of clay affect its interpretation (e.g., in terms of religious or economic value)?

-THINK LIKE AN ART HISTORIAN: How does the Judean Pillar Figurine compare to feminized figures that came before? What does its gaze imply about its character?

-THINK LIKE A SOCIOLOGIST: How can RTI data be used to pursue questions of Judean Pillar Figurine workshops and trade?

-THINK LIKE AN ANTHROPOLOGIST: How are figurines used and conceptualized in the modern world? Why does this object type have so much staying power?
