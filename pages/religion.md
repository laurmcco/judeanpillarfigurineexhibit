I have used this site to democratize access to imaging technology (particularly Reflectance Transformation Imaging) as well as the Judean Pillar Figurines. Do you find that the images carry an air of authority? Do they make you hesitant to question my findings? Like all interpretations, mine must be held up to scrutiny. 

I use RTI views of B2018.1.1 to argue that Judean Pillar Figurine artisans spent extra time and effort crafting the eyes. However, one needs to be able to read a "normals" image to test that hypothesis, and even then, the data are not incontrovertible. 
It is not possible to view them without bias or in their original contexts. Attending to manufacture to trace artisan attention as a window into their intentions and perceived values or functions of the JPF. To do this we can look at ancient kilns, pottery workshops or texts pertaining to them, or in my case, the tool marks and surface impressions on the figurines. Where did the artisans spend their time? Cf. with breasts.

RTI can tell surface information, aiding in object documentation (for example, to track deterioration over time) but it cannot tell measurement. We can learn about manufacture, which reflects artisan intentionality, which reflects artisan values and/or the values of the audiences creating demand for Judean Pillar Figurines to be created. 

RTI uses and benefits:
-Reveal or clarify fine surface details (tool marks, fingerprints, thick paint)
-

RTI limitations and drawbacks:
-Air of authority for images, as if they are self-evident
-Measurement not currently possible from RTI images

How does technology affect our ability to see and interpret ancient artifacts?

What do we assume to be true about these feminized bodies

It could fit into your point about how it's not just documentation (which is what I still often see) ~this is good for my think about religion page! What uses are there for RTI then guide the teachers to appreciate each. 

the fragility, cultural preservation. Enabling access to our cultural history for future generations is a critical need that inspires our work. The imaging practices we teach support important scientific and art historical research. They also yield detailed records for preservation.
