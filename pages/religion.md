## Sculptures in Motion

As you rotate the above 3D model, note the presentation of the pupils. We saw on the "Relight Artifacts" page that these pupils were probably pre-indicated through the use of a circular tool. This 3D model with DecorrelationStretch applied works in remote sensing to exaggerate color contrasts, in our case to show traces of paint. Rotating the 3D model from front view to either of the side views reveals an optical illusion. The concave shape of the eye basins “swallows” much of the pupil’s diameter when viewed from the front, but display the fuller area when viewed from the sides. The pupils look bigger from the sides than they do from the front. This makes the eyes seem reactive. Alive, even. 

Where contexts of use have been found in the archaeological record, JPFs seem to be religious. They were found in assemblages with other objects also deemed religious, and even in the overt religious spaces of tombs (though rarely). Also, JPFs and other figurine types received a base coat of whitewash while other object types did not. This makes figurines seem like they were separated out and treated in a special way. Further, the JPF's body looks supernatural. Its lower half is not human and eyes can be so large that they consume the face (like the example above). The leading stimulus that causes pupil movement is light. The above figurine has a narrative quality in that it is depicted as engaged with something outside of itself, a bright light.

In the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, light is a leading way that God is described aniconically (without artistic representation). How can we investigate what it might have meant to stare into the eyes of a hybrid creature who is bathed in God's light? We might contextualize these descriptors against ancient Near Eastern texts or we might study conceptions of vision or visual encounter through time. We could also compare features (nudity, pose with hands at breasts, pillar figurines, style of jewelry) seen on the JPF to other objects with better-understood uses. 

This research is illuminating, yet still not enough to "settle" the mysteries that underlie JPFs. "Original context" is irretrievably lost. Nonetheless, we have uncovered new potentialities, particularly over the topic of presence. Without needing to debunk alternative options, one function of the JPF seems to involve making the divine immediate and present. Imaging technologies provide a new possibility to puzzle over: that JPFs were understood to have watchful eyes.

## Look Again: Guiding Questions for the Use of this Exhibit by Educators

(There are imbrications among the following broad disciplinary approaches)

- THINK LIKE A CONSERVATOR: What questions can be pursued by Reflectance Transformation Imaging? Pick a point of interest on one of the JPFs imaged on this site and theorize what it reveals.

- THINK LIKE A COMPUTER SCIENTIST: How does the computer "know" the position of a light source in RTI capture?

- THINK LIKE A CURATOR: What stories might Judean Pillar Figurines tell about Israelite women? 

- THINK LIKE AN ARCHAEOLOGIST: Judean Pillar Figurines are found ubiquitously throughout ancient Judean towns. What can and can't broad find-spots (in public and private buildings, in streets, alleyways, and cisterns, as fill underneath floors and in mud brick walls, in tombs, and especially in and around Judean homes) reveal about the use life of these objects?

- THINK LIKE A BIBLICAL SCHOLAR: JPFs are from ancient Judah. Research ancient Judean conceptualizations of clay via the Bible. How does the fact that an object is made out of clay affect its interpretation (e.g., in terms of religious or economic value)?

- THINK LIKE AN ART HISTORIAN: How does the Judean Pillar Figurine compare to feminized figures that came before? What does its gaze imply about its character?

- THINK LIKE A SOCIOLOGIST: How can RTI data (like tool marks or fingerprints) be used to pursue questions of Judean Pillar Figurine workshops and trade?

- THINK LIKE AN ANTHROPOLOGIST: How are figurines used and conceptualized in the modern world? Why does this object type have so much staying power?
