As you rotate the above 3D model, note the presentation of the pupils. We saw on the "Relight Artifacts" page that these pupils were probably pre-indicated through the use of a circular tool. This 3D model with DecorrelationStretch layered on works in remote sensing to exaggerate the traces of paint that exist. Rotating the image from front view to either of the side views reveals an optical illusion. The concave shape of the eye basins “swallow” much of the pupil’s diameter when viewed from the front, but display the fuller area when viewed from the side. This makes the eyes seem reactive. Alive, even. 

Where contexts of use have been found in the archaeological record, JPFs seem to be religious. They were found in assemblages with other objects also deemed religious, and (rarely) even in the overt religious spaces of tombs. Also, JPFs and other figurine types received a base coat of whitewash while other object types did not. This makes figurines seem like they were separated out and especially treated. Further, the JPF's body looks supernatural. Its lower half is not human and eyes can be so large that they consume the face (like above). Finally, the leading stimulus that causes pupil movement is light. The above figurine has a narrative quality to it in that it is depicted as engaged with something outside of itself, a bright light.

In the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, light is a leading way that God is described aniconically (without artistic representation). How can we investigate what it might have meant to stare into the eyes of a hybrid creature who is bathed in God's light? We might contextualize these descriptors against ancient Near Eastern texts, or we might study conceptions of vision or visual encounter through time. We could also compare features (nudity, pose with hands at breasts, pillar figurines, style of jewelry) seen on the JPF to other objects with better-understood uses. 

This research is illuminating, yet still not enough to "settle" the mysteries that underlie JPFs. We do not know their identity and we very rarely know how they were used. Nonetheless, we have uncovered new potentialities for these figurines, particularly over the topic of presence. For whatever else they represented, the JPFs' function seems to be presence: they make the divine present. 

## Look Again: Guiding Questions for the Use of this Web Exhibit by Educators

(There are imbrications among the following disciplinary approaches)

- THINK LIKE A CONSERVATOR: What questions can be pursued by Reflectance Transformation Imaging? Pick a point of interest on one of the JPFs imaged on this site and theorize what it might reveal.

- THINK LIKE A COMPUTER SCIENTIST: How does the computer "know" the position of a light source in RTI capture?

- THINK LIKE A CURATOR: What stories might Judean Pillar Figurines tell about Israelite women, so woefully underrepresented in the Bible? 

- THINK LIKE AN ARCHAEOLOGIST: Judean Pillar Figurines are found ubiquitously throughout ancient Judean towns. What can broad find-spots (in public and private buildings, in streets, alleyways, and cisterns, as fill underneath floors and in mud brick walls, in tombs, and especially in and around Judean homes) reveal about the use life of these objects?

- THINK LIKE A BIBLICAL SCHOLAR: JPFs are from ancient Judah. Research ancient Judean conceptualizations of clay via the Bible. How does the fact that an object is made out of clay affect its interpretation (e.g., in terms of religious or economic value)?

- THINK LIKE AN ART HISTORIAN: How does the Judean Pillar Figurine compare to feminized figures that came before? What does its gaze imply about its character?

- THINK LIKE A SOCIOLOGIST: How can RTI data be used to pursue questions of Judean Pillar Figurine workshops and trade?

- THINK LIKE AN ANTHROPOLOGIST: How are figurines used and conceptualized in the modern world? Why does this object type have so much staying power?
