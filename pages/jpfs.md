Judean Pillar Figurines are a popular topic in biblical studies that have also captured the popular imagination. Given the Second Commandment that prohibits the creation of images, it is surprising to find over 1,000 (and counting!) of these miniature feminized art pieces in ancient Judah. Scholars are not sure who or what they represent. Various interpretations have been offered, which sometimes overlap:

- God’s wife
- Another goddess
- Fertility figures
- Idols
- Low gods (like angels)
- Toys
- Human worshipers 

Neither are scholars sure how these figurines were used. They are usually found broken, leading many to assume ritual "deactivation" once a figurine was used for an intended purpose. Others take breakage as evidence of iconoclasm in ancient Judah, as the Second Cokmmandment might lead one to expect. Yet others conclude that JPFs are broken in structurally weak places, meaning that their breakage is not intentional or meaningful. In fact JPFs were excavated in all manner of places in Judean cities and towns: as fill under floors or in walls, in tombs (usually not broken), in streets and alleys, in public buildings, but most of all in and around homes. The home context opens conversations about JPFs as part of some traditional, unofficial religion (as opposed to elite Temple religion as it is reported in the Bible). 

Cutting across the majority of interpretations about JPF identity and use is the sense that JPFs were positive figures meant to bring blessing. Virtually all interpreters agree on that much, due to elements like the JPF's slight smile and beneficent posture with hands-at-breasts.
