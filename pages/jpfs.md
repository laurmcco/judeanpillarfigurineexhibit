Judean Pillar Figurines are a popular topic in biblical studies that have also captured the popular imagination. Given the Second Commandment that prohibits the creation of images, it is surprising to find over 1,000 (and counting!) of these miniature feminized art pieces in ancient Judah. Scholars are not sure who or what they represent. Various interpretations have been offered, which sometimes overlap:

- Godâ€™s wife
- Another goddess
- Fertility figures
- Idols
- Low gods (like angels)
- Toys
- Human worshipers 

This web exhibit will give audiences the chance to see Judean Pillar Figurines again, in a new light. Reflectance Transformation Imaging makes it possible to view never-before seen surface details of Judean Pillar Figurines. Decorrelation Stretch imaging utilizes remote sensing to exaggerate faint traces of paint. Together these tools unlock new avenues of interpretation for the interpretation of ancient artifacts, which we will explore here. 

What changes about artifact interpretation when we see them with technology?
