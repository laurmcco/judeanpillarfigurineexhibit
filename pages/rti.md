Here is where you can view Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) for three views of a Judean Pillar Figurine fragment. This is a special object for the amount of paint it still contains. 

Click anywhere on the images to manipulate the direction of a virtual light. Zoom in to observe the figurine's surface and anything of interest upon it (for example indentations, brush strokes, paint). Click the layers icon to navigate various rendering environments: “normals” shows the surface topography through false color, “diffuse” shows surface topography with color removed, and “specular” shows the surface with a shiny quality. In "specular" mode, you can manipulate the direction of light at the same time that you increase or decrease the light’s intensity via a slider.

1) Browse the first RTI image below. What colors do you see, and where? <position RTI of left eye first on the page instead of second>
2) Use the layers icon to enter the “normals” mode and the “specular” mode. In what area does paint leave an imprint on the surface? Once you find the imprint, or if you cannot find it after a few minutes, click below.

Hidden box 1 reads “In what area does paint leave an imprint on the surface?” then when users click the box this text appears: “The pupil. Why might the pupil paint leave a different footprint on the surface than the rest of the paint? Does seeing the pupil’s imprint help you now perceive black paint in the default/”light” mode? You have just discovered that RTI shows color not only chromatically but through imprints like this that get left on the surface, not visible to the naked eye.”
Hidden box 2, reads: “Why might the pupil paint leave a different footprint on the surface than the rest of the paint?” then when users clock the box this text appears: “It seems that the paint was applied in more layers at the pupil than it was in other areas, like the eyeliner or the (very colorful!) neck. Check out the general lack of imprint paint leaves on these areas compared to the pupil.
