Welcome to the RTI Laboratory. Here is where you can view and manipulate three RTIs of a Judean Pillar Figurine fragment. This is a special object for the amount of paint it still contains. 

Click anywhere on the RTI images to change the direction of a virtual light. Zoom in to observe the figurine's surface and anything of interest upon it (for example indentations, brush strokes, paint). Click the "layers" icon to explore various rendering environments: “normals” shows the surface shape through false color, “diffuse” shows surface shape with color removed, and “specular” shows the surface with a shiny quality. In "specular" mode, you can manipulate the direction of light at the same time that you increase or decrease the light’s intensity via a slider.

1) Browse the first RTI image below. What colors do you see, and where?

2) Use the layers icon to enter the “normals” mode and the “specular” mode. There is one particular area with a circular imprint on the surface. Can you find it? Once you do, or if you can't find it after a few minutes, click the buttons below.

{% include feature/collapse.html button="Where is the circular imprint on this figurine's surface?" color="outline-info" text="The pupil. Something created a circular imprint on the surface. What do you think could have caused it? Does seeing the pupil’s imprint help you now perceive a circle of black paint in the default/”light” mode? You have just discovered that RTI shows color not only chromatically but through imprints left on the surface, invisible to the naked eye. There is a similar imprint in the other eye, though more faint. Can you find it?" %}

{% include feature/collapse.html button="What could have caused the circular imprint on this figurine’s surface?" color="outline-primary" title="Answer" text="Whatever process was used to paint this figurine’s pupils black, it created a circular rim on the surface of both eyes. Perhaps the artisan painted the pupils with a firm hand, pre-etched them prior to painting, or painted the rim in multiple layers. We cannot be sure. But RTI expands the conversations we can have about Judean Pillar Figurines by showing evidence of manufacture. Fine surface details reveal that the eyes were crafted differently than the rest of this figurine. For example, there is also black paint in the eyeliner and neck bands, but without corresponding imprints. Scrutinize the 3 RTI images of these areas to compare. The artisan used an alternate method to paint the pupils than the rest of the figurine, which makes them seem important." %}
