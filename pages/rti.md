Here is where you can view Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) for three views of a Judean Pillar Figurine fragment. This is a special object for the amount of paint it still contains. 

Click anywhere on the images to manipulate the direction of a virtual light. Zoom in to observe the figurine's surface and anything of interest upon it (for example indentations, brush strokes, paint). Click the layers icon to explore various rendering environments: “normals” shows the surface shape through false color, “diffuse” shows surface shape with color removed, and “specular” shows the surface with a shiny quality. In "specular" mode, you can manipulate the direction of light at the same time that you increase or decrease the light’s intensity via a slider.

1) Browse the first RTI image below. What colors do you see, and where?

2) Use the layers icon to enter the “normals” mode and the “specular” mode. There is one particular area where paint leaves a circular imprint on the surface. Can you find it? Once you do, or if you cannot find the imprint after a few minutes, click below.

## Accordion 

{% include feature/accordion.html title1="In what area does paint leave a circular imprint on the surface?" text1="The pupil. Why might the pupil paint have created a raised imprint on the surface but paint in other areas looks flat? Does seeing the pupil’s imprint help you now perceive a circle of black paint in the default/”light” mode? You have just discovered that RTI shows color not only chromatically but through imprints left on the surface, not visible to the naked eye." title2="Why might paint leave a different footprint in one area of the figurine's surface than it does on others?" text2="It seems that the paint was applied in more layers at the pupil than elsewhere on the figurine, like the eyeliner or the (very colorful!) neck. Check out the general lack of imprint on these areas compared to the pupil. The artisan applied extra layers of paint at the pupils." id="1" %}
