    <p class="essay-text">Here is where you can view Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) for three views of a Judean Pillar Figurine fragment. This is a special object for the amount of paint it still contains. 

1) What colors do you see, and where? <go to RTI of left eye, second RTI shown>
2) Go to the “normals” mode and to the “specular” mode. In what area does paint leave an imprint on the surface? If you cannot find the imprint after 5 minutes, click below.

Hidden box 1, Answer to Question 2: The pupil! Why might the pupil leave a different footprint on the surface than the rest of the paint? Does seeing the pupil’s imprint help you now perceive black paint in the default/”light” mode? RTI shows color not only chromatically but through imprints like this that get left on the surface.
Hidden box 2: It seems that the paint was applied in more layers at the pupil than it was in other areas like the eyeliner or the (very colorful!) neck. Check out these areas in various viewing modes. What do you see?

General instructions for viewing RTIs on this site: Click anywhere on the image to manipulate the direction of a virtual light. Zoom in to observe the figurine's surface and anything of interest upon it (e.g., indentations, brush strokes, paint). Click the layers icon to navigate various rendering environments: “normals” shows the surface topography through false color, “diffuse” shows surface topography with color removed, and “specular” shows the surface with a shiny quality. In "specular" mode, you can manipulate the direction of light at the same time that you increase or decrease the light’s intensity via a slider. 

What do you see?
