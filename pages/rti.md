    <p class="essay-text">This is a space where you can view Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) for three views of a Judean Pillar Figurine. Zoom in to observe the figurine, and anything of interest, like its paint. Click anywhere on the image to enhance these views by manipulating the direction of a virtual light. Click the "layers" button to navigate various rendering environments: **normals** shows the surface topography through false color, **diffuse** shows surface topography with color removed, and **specular** shows the surface with a shiny quality. In specular mode, one can manipulate the direction of the apparent light at the same time that they increase or decrease the light's intensity via a slider.  </p>
