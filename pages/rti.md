Welcome to the Reflectance Transformation Imaging Laboratory. Here is where you can view and manipulate three RTIs of a Judean Pillar Figurine fragment. This is a special object for the amount of paint it still contains. 

Click anywhere on the RTI images to change the direction of a virtual light. Zoom in to observe the figurine's surface and anything of interest upon it (for example tool marks, fingerprints, paint). Click the "layers" icon to explore various rendering environments: “normals” shows the surface shape through false color, “diffuse” shows surface shape with color removed, and “specular” shows the surface with a shiny quality. In "specular" mode, you can manipulate the direction of light at the same time that you increase or decrease the light’s intensity via a slider.

1) Browse the first RTI image below. What colors do you see, and where?

2) Use the layers icon to enter the “normals” mode and the “specular” mode. There is one particular area with a circular mark on the surface. Can you find it? Once you do, or if you can't find it after a few minutes, click the buttons below.

{% include feature/collapse.html button="Where is the circular mark on this figurine's surface?" color="outline-info" text="The pupil. For some reason, there is a rim around the pupil. Switch into the default/”light” mode. What color paint fills the pupil rim? You have just discovered that RTI shows color not only chromatically but through imprints left on the surface, invisible to the naked eye. The pupil is perceptible not only through color but surface imprints. There is a similar circular mark in the other eye, though more faint. Now that you have some experience manipulating a virtual light and observing this artifact's topography, can you find the circular pupil mark in the other eye? It is difficult to see!" %}

{% include feature/collapse.html button="What could have caused the circular mark on this figurine’s eye surface?" color="outline-primary" title="Answer" text="Whatever process was used to paint this figurine’s pupils, it created a circular rim on the surface of both eyes. Perhaps the artisan pre-etched circles prior to painting them black or painted the pupil perimeter in multiple layers, creating the circular rims we are investigating now. 

We cannot be sure what caused the pupil marks. But RTI expands the conversations we can have about Judean Pillar Figurines, here by giving evidence for special manufacture of the eyes. Fine surface details reveal that the eyes were crafted differently than the rest of this figurine. For example, black paint was also used for eyeliner and neck bands, but without causing corresponding marks. The artisan used an alternate method to paint the pupils than the rest of the figurine, which makes them seem important. Usually interpreters stress the breasts as the most crucial part of the Judean Pillar Figurine, but now we have reason to appreciate the eyes, too.

View the remaining 2 RTI images of this artifact to compare views of the pupils, and anything else of interest." %}
