    <p class="essay-text">This is a space where you can view Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) for three views of a Judean Pillar Figurine. Zoom in to observe the figurine and anything of interest, like its paint. Click anywhere on the image to enhance these views by manipulating the direction of a virtual light. Click the layers icon to navigate various rendering environments: "normals" shows the surface topography through false color, "diffuse" shows surface topography with color removed, and "specular" shows the surface with a shiny quality. In specular mode, users can manipulate the direction of apparent light at the same time that they increase or decrease that light's intensity via a slider. What do you see? </p>
