Judean Pillar Figurines are a popular topic in biblical studies and have also captured the popular imagination. Given the Second Commandment that prohibits the creation of images, it is surprising to find over 1,000 (and counting!) of these art pieces in ancient Judah. Scholarly interpretations hold that they represent God’s wife, another goddess, fertility figures, idols, low gods (like angels), toys, and/or human worshipers. Sometimes these readings overlap.

JPFs look like familiar figures, and yet, they hold many secrets. Their identity and function are notoriously difficult to pin down. I have studied them for years at universities and museums–and have even used emergent imaging technology to analyze them in new ways–but still, JPFs stir more questions than they do answers. 


**The Author.** Lauren K. McCormick is a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University’s Center for Culture, Society, and Religion. She has degrees from Rutgers University, New York University, Duke University, and Syracuse University.

**The Project.** This web exhibit takes an immersive, multi-modal approach to the JPFs. There are many ways of looking at these artifacts, which the RTI Laboratory shows in a literal sense, allowing users to drag light across an exceptionally well-preserved JPF head. The Gallery presents photos, has a special section dedicated to colorized JPFs (usually JPFs look tan because that is the color of their clay without paint), and offers a 3D model for the user to manipulate. I also offer a video podcast dedicated to asking modern questions of the JPF.
