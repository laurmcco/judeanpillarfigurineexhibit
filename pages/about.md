Judean Pillar Figurines are a popular topic in biblical studies that have also captured the popular imagination. Given the Second Commandment that prohibits the creation of images, it is surprising to find over 1,000 (and counting!) of these miniature feminized art pieces in ancient Judah. Scholars are not sure who or what they represent. Various interpretations have been offered, which sometimes overlap:

- God’s wife
- Another goddess
- Fertility figures
- Idols
- Low gods (like angels)
- Toys
- Human worshipers 

JPFs invite a wide range of questions and approaches. None are inscribed, no biblical texts mention them, and they lack attributes that would identify them, even in broad strokes as “human” or “divine.” This web exhibit will **Introduce the JPFs** and then foreground two imaging technologies used to analyze them, called DecorrelationStretch and Reflectance Transformation Imaging. The **Gallery** displays traditional photos alongside DecorrelationStretch photos and shows the JPFs in color by amplifying faint traces of paint. The **RTI Laboratory** enables users to relight a JPF fragment for themselves by manipulating a virtual light. Discovery will be at your fingertips as you navigate (and create!) these never-before-seen views.

The **Getting Past Religion Podcast** moves beyond imaging technology to explore other perspectives on the JPFs, with an eye toward how these artifacts and their study connect to today. The podcast discusses various pressing topics as they intersect with the JPF: racism, the oppression of women, nudity in art, object agency, gender diversity, and technology. What do our approaches to the JPF reveal not just about ancient people in biblical times, but also about us? How can JPFs be a resource as we navigate the contemporary world, for example, in what we presume feminine bodies can and can’t do?

JPFs are difficult to define and so is the study of religion. JPFs seem religiously significant due to certain archaeological contexts in which they are found and also because of the traditional pose in which they stand (with arms enwrapping breasts). Imaging technology reveals that JPF eyes were also a key feature of the JPF in its original, painted state. In **Think About Religion**, I will explore, as a test case, how JPF eyes may be analyzed via religious studies. I will consider the JPF as a window into ancient experiences of religion, but also into the modern enterprise of knowledge production. I will include study questions to aid in the use of this site as a resource for educators.

Let There Be Light explores various cutting-edge technologies, approaches, and ideas driving Religious Studies today. It pursues evidence that opens new lines of inquiry for the JPFs, but without diminishing the value of other approaches. This project aims to figuratively and literally turn the lights on the JPFs, opening new possibilities and potentialities. I find that the addition of concrete, new data points inadvertently makes the JPFs seem more elusive. resisting the authority that any single interpretation might bring. I aim to show the benefits of resisting the urge to locate one authoritative reading for them
