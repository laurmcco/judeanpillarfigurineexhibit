This web exhibit works to democratize access to both ancient artifacts and modern imaging technologies (especially Reflectance Transformation Imaging). It will [**Introduce the JPFs**]({{ '/jpfs.html' | relative_url }}) and then foreground multiple imaging technologies that can be used to analyze or display them. The [**Gallery**]({{ '/browse.html' | relative_url }}) displays traditional photos alongside Reflectance Transformation Imaging files, DecorrelationStretch photos, 3D models, and an object movie. These methodologies enable new views and modes of engagement with Judean Pillar Figurines, which I use to pursue questions about paint. Other questions are possible and will hopefully be pursued by users like you. The **RTI Laboratory** invites users to relight JPF fragments for themselves by manipulating a virtual light in various rendering environments, revealing fine surface details not visible to the naked eye. Discovery will be at your fingertips as you navigate (and create!) these never-before-seen views. [**Think About Religion**]({{ '/religion.html' | relative_url }}) provides study questions to aid in the use of this site for educators.

While the RTI Laboratory puts Judean Pillar Figurine data in your hands, the [**Getting Past Religion Podcast**]({{ '/podcast.html' | relative_url }}) explores yet other perspectives on the JPFs by engaging them topically. This video podcast explores various pressing issues as they intersect with the JPF: racism, the oppression of women, nudity in art, gender diversity, technology, and attitudes toward matter in times of ecological crisis. The podcast investigates what differing views on the JPF can reveal about ancient people in biblical times, and also about us. How can JPFs be a resource as we navigate the contemporary world, for example, in what we presume feminine bodies can and can’t do?

Together, the Let There Be Light web exhibit and Getting Past Religion podcast aim to figuratively and literally illuminate the JPFs, opening new potentialities each time we look and relook, light and relight.

**The Author.** Dr. Lauren K. McCormick is a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University’s Center for Culture, Society, and Religion. She has degrees from Rutgers University, New York University, Duke University, and Syracuse University.

**The Project.** Let There Be Light is an open educational resource that takes an immersive, multi-modal approach toward cutting-edge technologies, approaches, and ideas driving Religious Studies today. All artifacts presented are from the collection of the Badè Museum at Pacific School of Religion (Berkeley, CA). They derive from Tell en-Naṣbeh, the likely biblical site of Mizpah. Support to develop the web exhibit was provided by the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) project including Julia Stone and Evan Peter Williamson from the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) at University of Idaho Library.
