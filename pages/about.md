Judean Pillar Figurines are a popular topic in biblical studies that have also captured the popular imagination. Given the Second Commandment that prohibits the creation of images, it is surprising to find over 1,000 (and counting!) of these miniature feminized art pieces in ancient Judah. Scholars are not sure who or what they represent. Various interpretations have been offered, which sometimes overlap:

- God’s wife
- Another goddess
- Fertility figures
- Idols
- Low gods (like angels)
- Toys
- Human worshipers 

This web exhibit will **Introduce the JPFs** and then foreground two imaging technologies used to analyze them, called DecorrelationStretch and Reflectance Transformation Imaging. The **Gallery** displays traditional photos alongside DecorrelationStretch photos and shows the JPFs in color by amplifying faint traces of paint. The **RTI Laboratory** enables users to relight a JPF fragment for themselves by manipulating a virtual light. Discovery will be at your fingertips as you navigate (and create!) these never-before-seen views.

The **Getting Past Religion Podcast** builds upon the imaging technology and explores other perspectives on the JPFs. The podcast discusses various pressing topics as they intersect with the JPF: racism, the oppression of women, nudity in art, object agency, gender diversity, and technology. What do our approaches to the JPF reveal not just about ancient people in biblical times, but also about us? How can JPFs be a resource as we navigate the contemporary world, for example, in what we presume feminine bodies can and can’t do?

JPFs invite a wide range of questions and approaches. They seem religiously significant due to certain archaeological contexts in which they are found and also because of the traditional pose in which they stand (with arms enwrapping breasts). But no JPF is inscribed, no biblical texts mention them, and in the end, the JPFs have just a few iconographic attributes. In **Think About Religion**, I will offer my findings of how paint impacts our estimations of the JPF's religious significance. New approaches and technologies expand our understanding of the JPF's meaning, but without settling it. How do we move from evidence to conclusion? When should conclusions resist offering an authoritative interpretation? I will also include study questions to aid in the use of this site for educators.

Let There Be Light explores various cutting-edge technologies, approaches, and ideas driving Religious Studies today. This project aims to figuratively and literally "turn the lights on" the JPFs, opening new potentialities and thinking critically about how knowledge is produced.
