This web exhibit will [**Introduce the JPFs**]({{ '/jpfs.html' | relative_url }}) and then foreground two imaging technologies used to analyze them, called DecorrelationStretch and Reflectance Transformation Imaging. The [**Gallery**]({{ '/browse.html' | relative_url }}) displays traditional photos alongside DecorrelationStretch photos and shows the JPFs in color by amplifying faint traces of paint. The **RTI Laboratory** enables users to relight a JPF fragment for themselves by manipulating a virtual light. Discovery will be at your fingertips as you navigate (and create!) these never-before-seen views.

The [**Getting Past Religion Podcast**]({{ '/podcast.html' | relative_url }}) builds upon the imaging technology and explores other perspectives on the JPFs. The podcast discusses various pressing topics as they intersect with the JPF: racism, the oppression of women, nudity in art, object agency, gender diversity, and technology. What do our approaches to the JPF reveal not just about ancient people in biblical times, but also about us? How can JPFs be a resource as we navigate the contemporary world, for example, in what we presume feminine bodies can and can’t do?

JPFs invite a wide range of questions and approaches. They seem religiously significant due to certain archaeological contexts in which they are found and also because of the traditional pose in which they stand (with arms enwrapping breasts). But no JPF is inscribed, no biblical texts mention them, and in the end, the JPFs have just a few iconographic attributes. In [**Think About Religion**]({{ '/religion.html' | relative_url }}), I will offer my findings of how paint impacts our estimations of the JPF's religious significance. What changes when we see them in color? New approaches and technologies expand our understanding of JPF meaning, but without settling it. How do we move from evidence to conclusion? Should conclusions offer authoritative interpretations? I will also include study questions to aid in the use of this site for educators.

Let There Be Light explores various cutting-edge technologies, approaches, and ideas driving Religious Studies today. This project aims to figuratively and literally "turn the lights on" the JPFs, opening new potentialities and thinking critically about how we come to "know" the things we do.

**The Author.** Lauren K. McCormick is a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University’s Center for Culture, Society, and Religion. She has degrees from Rutgers University, New York University, Duke University, and Syracuse University.

**The Project.** This web exhibit takes an immersive, multi-modal approach to the JPFs. All objects presented are from the collection of the Badè Museum at Pacific School of Religion (Berkeley, CA). They derive from Tell en-Naṣbeh, the likely biblical site of Mizpah. Support to develop the web exhibit was provided by the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) project including Julia Stone and Evan Peter Williamson from the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/) at University of Idaho Library.
