Judean Pillar Figurines are a popular topic in biblical studies that have also captured the popular imagination. Given the Second Commandment that prohibits the creation of images, it is surprising to find over 1,000 (and counting!) of these miniature feminized art pieces in ancient Judah. Scholars are not sure who or what they represent. Various interpretations have been offered, which sometimes overlap:

- God’s wife
- Another goddess
- Fertility figures
- Idols
- Low gods (like angels)
- Toys
- Human worshipers 

JPFs invite a wide range of questions and approaches. They have no inscriptions, no biblical texts mention them, and they lack attributes that would identify them, even in broad strokes as “human” or “divine.” This web exhibit will **Introduce the JPFs** and then foreground two cutting-edge methodologies used to analyze them, involving imaging technologies called DecorrelationStretch and Reflectance Transformation Imaging. The **Gallery** displays traditional photos alongside DecorrelationStretch photos, which show the JPFs in color by amplifying faint traces of paint. The **RTI Laboratory** enables users to relight a JPF fragment for themselves by manipulating a virtual light. Discovery will be at your fingertips as you navigate (and create!) these never-before-seen views.

The **Getting Past Religion Podcast** explores other perspectives on the JPFs, with an eye toward how these artifacts and their study connect to today. The podcast discusses various pressing topics as they intersect with the JPF: racism, the oppression of women, nudity in art, object agency, gender diversity, and technology. What do our approaches to the JPF reveal not just about ancient people in biblical times, but also about us? How can JPFs be a resource as we navigate the contemporary world, for example, in what we presume feminine bodies can and can’t do? 

The JPFs invite many questions not only because their meaning is elusive, but also because they take part in the study of religion. The JPFs seem religiously significant based on certain archaeological contexts in which they are found plus the traditional pose in which they stand. But religion is notoriously difficult to define. Imaging technology data suggests that the eyes were a central part of JPF composition. In **Think About Religion**, I will explore as a test case how JPF eyes contributes to religious studies through the idea of presence. I will also include study questions to aid in the use of this site as a resource for educators.
